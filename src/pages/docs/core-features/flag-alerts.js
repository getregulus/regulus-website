            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Flag alerts are automatically generated when a transaction matches
              rules or watchlists configured in your organization. These alerts
              allow your compliance or monitoring teams to review suspicious
              activity quickly.

              How Flag Alerts Work
            </h2>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              <li>A transaction is received and validated..</li>
              <li>
                It is checked against organization-specific watchlists and
                evaluated by the rule engine.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a match occurs, a <strong>flag alert</strong> is created and
                logged for auditing purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alerts are sent asynchronously through the platform and via
                configured integrations.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Flag alerts are also delivered to external systems using
              integrations such as webhooks or other 3rd-party applications. See

              Viewing and Managing Alerts

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Your team can retrieve, create, or delete alerts via the API.
              Alerts include key details such as transaction ID, reason for
              flagging, timestamp, and linked transaction data.
            </p>

              Exporting Alerts
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              For reporting or compliance purposes, all flag alerts can be
              exported as CSV. The export includes transaction details, alert
              reasons, and timestamps. This allows easy review or ingestion into
              other systems.

              <li>
